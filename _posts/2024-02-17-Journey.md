<!-- Often I saw my Github account and thinks if I would have started a little bit more early i would have done really good but I have been started doing it as i am doing now ...

I started my cybersecurity carrer in my 11th standard(2019) when i saw one student making some project on protecting nuclear power plant from cyberwar, I was amazed when he booted a linux distro Kali at that time from his bootable pendrive and I asked him what is this (ye kya hai??), then he told me that this is a kali linux operating system which is booting from his pendrive, I was amazed that this whole operating system is running on this pendrive, then I came home and serched on youtube how to make bootable pendrive on my fathers laptop ....


then it was time around feb or march 2020 that my father bought me a second hand i5 4th gen hp elite desk 800 at @12000 rupees and I started working on it and created my first mail id prashantdangi983@gmail.com  -->
