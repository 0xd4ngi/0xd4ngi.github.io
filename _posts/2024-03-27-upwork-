I am a dedicated and passionate professional with a focus on developing skills and training students to enhance their expertise in the 
field of ethical hacking and cybersecurity.
As a committed member of the Ciphers Club, I have organized and hosted Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, creating 
opportunities for hands-on learning and practical experience in cybersecurity.

My experience also includes research and the development of educational materials on security best practices, 
with a particular interest in Wi-Fi security and breaking WPA2/3 access modes through frame aggregation and fragmentation.

In addition to my professional contributions, I maintain a blog where I share insights on the latest cybersecurity topics, 
vulnerabilities, exploits, and more. I initially hosted the website on my own computer, configuring the Apache webserver and 
managing domain name tunneling. You can find my blogs at corruptbit.blogspot.com.

Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science with a specialization in Cybersecurity, I possess a wide range of 
technical skills in programming languages such as C, Assembly, C++, Java, Python, and more. I'm well-versed in various tools, including Git, 
Linux, and Docker, and stay up-to-date with the latest CVEs, security threats, and vulnerabilities.

My project portfolio includes the development of a Ransomware Detection Toolkit using Python scripts and a real-time application 
called "BU eve" built in Flask to keep the university community informed about ongoing events. I've also engaged in an unofficial project 
related to booting a Linux distro through Bitvisor Hypervisor configured to send log files through a UDP connection.

As a leader and core research member of Corrupt Bit at Bennett University, I am dedicated to contributing to the field of cybersecurity
and making a positive impact. You can reach me at dangiprashant900@gmail.com.
