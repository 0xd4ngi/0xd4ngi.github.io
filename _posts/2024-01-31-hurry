we are always in a hurry that if we get the one thing which made others successfull we will also be successfull by doing that one thing but the thing that we ae unaware of is that we can not be the same guy as him/her we are different and he is different. He has a different life path than us

we will also have a different trajectory to get to the same heights so BE YOURSELF!

and the same applies to when we write there is not a single word that defines a situation its only the most suitable one ..
